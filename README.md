# The-Dice-Game
A game made by JavaScript

This is a game that I learn to make on class. 

Step 1: Press to roll dice button.
Step 2: If the player rolled 1, then it will switch to another player. All scores will be removed when a player rolled 1
Step 3: Player can choose to hold the current score they have by pressing hold button so that when they rolled 1 they won't lost all their scores. 
Step 4: The first player who get to score 100 wins the game. 
Step 5: Press new game button to restart the game.
